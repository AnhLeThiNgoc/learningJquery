<h2>Part 1, Section 3</h2>
<h3 id="f-subtitle">Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland</h3>
<div id="excerpt">an excerpt</div>
<div class="chapter">
	
	<p class="square">Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to
	which class I myself belong) and Five-Sided Figures or <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon">Pentagons</a>.</p>
		
	<p class="nobility hexagon">Next above these come the Nobility, of
	whom there are several degrees, beginning at Six-Sided Figures, or <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">Hexagons</a>, and from
	thence rising in the number of their sides till they receive the
	honourable title of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/
	wiki/Polygon">Polygonal</a>,
	or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes so numerous,
	and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot be
	distinguished from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">circle</a>,
	he is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is the
	highest class of all.</p>
	
	<p><span class="pull-quote">It is a <span class="drop">Law
	of Nature</span> with us that a male child shall have <strong>one more
	side</strong> than his father</span>, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one
	step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a Square
	is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.</p>

	<p>Rarely&mdash;in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles
	births&mdash;is a genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle
	produced from Isosceles parents. <span class="footnote">"What need
	of a certificate?" a Spaceland critic may ask: "Is not the
	procreation of a Square Son a certificate from Nature herself,
	proving the Equal‑sidedness of the Father?" I reply that no Lady
	of any position will marry an uncertified Triangle. Square
	offspring has sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular
	Triangle; but in almost every such case the Irregularity of the
	first generation is visited on the third; which either fails to
	attain the Pentagonal rank, or relapses to the Triangular.</span>
	Such a birth requires, as its antecedents, not only a series of
	carefully arranged intermarriages, but also a long-continued
	exercise of frugality and self-control on the part of the would-be
	ancestors of the coming Equilateral, and a patient, systematic,
	and continuous development of the Isosceles intellect through many
	generations.
	</p>
	<p>The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents
	is the subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs
	round. After a strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and
	Social Board, the infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn
	ceremonial admitted into the class of Equilaterals. He is then
	immediately taken from his proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted
	by some childless Equilateral. <span class="footnote">The
	Equilateral is bound by oath never to permit the child henceforth
	to enter his former home or so much as to look upon his relations
	again, for fear lest the freshly developed organism may, by force
	of unconscious imitation, fall back again into his hereditary
	level.</span>
	</p>
	<p><span class="pull-quote">admirable is the Law of Compensation! <span class="footnote">
	And how perfect a proof of the natural fitness and,</span> I may almost
	say, the divine origin of the aristocratic constitution of the
	States of Flatland!</span> By a judicious use of this Law of
	Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always able to stifle
	sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the irrepressible
	and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.&hellip;</p>
